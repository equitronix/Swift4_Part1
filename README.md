# iOS programming with Swift4 - Part1

## Swiftly - learn on my own. Vol I

This is the first volume of a series that we are creating as a complete tutorial to learn iOS programming Swift 4. It is expected that you have some familarity with Swift as a programming language - though we will be covering the language in some detail.  

In this project we will have a simple student database. This database holds just 2 fields, name and address. The UI comprises of 2 labels that dislay the name and address and two buttons for selecting the next student and to display the address of the selected student. When the application is launched - it will display the name of the first student in the database. The address is not displayed by default. The user can either click the button to pull up the next student or display the address of the displayed student. By defualt when a new student name is displayed, his/her address is not displayed.

## Overview
In this first part you will learn:
1. A basic overview of xcode
2. You also create a fully funcitonal iOS application, although a simple one. 
3. Setting up a launch screen
4. Linking UI (storyboard) artefacts to your View Controller
5. MVC pattern and how it functions in the iOS world

## Development steps
1. Create a single page app
2. To the default storyboard add the following in order: 
* a label to display student name
* a button to pull up the next student
* a label to diaplay student address (of the student selected above)
* a button to display the address.
